# rs-mongodb cookbook



Provides recipes for managing volumes on a Server in a RightScale supported cloud which include:

* Creation of a replicaset with or without volume support (volumes required for backup and restore functionality)
* Taking backups of volumes

#Use Cases
Replicaset without volume support.
 - Set use_storage and restore_from_backup inputs to false and boot 3 nodes.
 - Once operational, on a single node execute the "rsc_mongodb::replicaset" recipe.
 - Once that completes you should have a replicaset configured and ready.
 
Replicaset with volume support.
 - Set the use_storage input to true and boot 3 nodes.
 - Once operational, on a single node execute the "rsc_mongodb::replicaset" recipe.
 - Once that completes you should have a replicaset configured and ready.
 
Restore Replicaset Node from a backup.
 - Set the restore_from_backup to true and boot a single node.
 - Once operational, execute the "rsc_mongodb::add_to_replicaset" recipe.
 - Once that completes you should have that member added to the replicaset
